Right now many of us in our community and beyond are feeling powerless in the face of this pandemic. Just at the time we need community the most, connection has become precarious, making it easy to become scattered and lost. Letâ€™s do something about it.

As specialists in interactive *telecommunications*, now is precisely when our skills are the most vital, so we are organizing a remote hackathon to bring together our community and show how much the work we do is meaningful in this troubling time.

The hackathon will kick off on **Friday, March 20th @ 7pm**.

Demos & presentations will start on **Sunday, March 22nd @ 4pm**.
